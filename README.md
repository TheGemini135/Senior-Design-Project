# Senior-Design-Project
Objective: Our senior design project consisted of creating a drone that would shoot out of a rocket at 8,000 - 10,000ft from the ground. The drone is programmed to autonomously fly out of the rocket, landing a golf ball inside a putt. Our collaborations consist of working with the Rocketeers of Southern Illinois (ROSI) on getting information for the designs of the rocket so that the mechanical engineers in our team can take proper measurements in designing the wings and body of the drone in order for the drone to fit inside the rocket and maneuver through the air in proper accordance.   My Role: As the programmer of the team my priorities consist of researching valuable parts and similar designs for the micro-controller - mRo PIXRacer R15. I was instructed as part of the senior design requirements to design and document the schematics and layout of the PIXRacer and to communicate to the team any updated information for changes or cost of products concerning the PIXRacer.   All cost of products was sponsored through Mayan Robotics, a company in Silicon Valley, that specializes in autonomous flight controllers.
