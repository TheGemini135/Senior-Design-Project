# Senior-Design-Project
Objective: Our senior design project consisted of creating a drone that would shoot out of a rocket at 8,000 - 10,000ft from the ground. The drone is programmed to autonomously fly out of the rocket while carrying a golf ball. The drone's primary obligation is to deliver the golf ball inside of a putt on the ground. Our collaborations consist of working with the Rocketeers of Southern Illinois (ROSI). Their task consist of designing the body and mechanics of the rocket. The mechanical engineers in our team were tasked to take proper measurements in designing the wings and body of the drone in order for the drone to fit inside the rocket and maneuver through the air accordingly.   

My Role: As the programmer of the team my priorities consist of researching valuable parts and compare similar designs of other drones found through research to come up with new ideas for designing the microcontroller - mRo PIXRacer R15. As instructed from the senior design requirements, my priorities consisted of designing and documenting the schematics and layout of the PIXRacer and to effectively communicate to the team of any updated information for changes or cost of products concerning the PIXRacer. All cost of products was sponsored through Mayan Robotics, a company in Silicon Valley that specializes in autonomous flight controllers.
